      Nwg-look is a GTK3 settings editor, designed to work properly in wlroots-based Wayland environment. The look and feel is strongly influenced by [LXAppearance](https://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXAppearance), but nwg-look is intended to free the user from a few inconveniences:
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>It works natively on Wayland. You no longer need Xwayland, nor strange env variables for it to run.</li>
      <li>It applies gsettings directly, with no need to use [workarounds](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/GTK-3-settings-on-Wayland). You don&apos;t need to set  gsettings in the sway config file. You don&apos;t need the <code>import-gsettings</code> script.</li>
    </ul></p>
